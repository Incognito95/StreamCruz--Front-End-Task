For this project i've chosen to use html, css, javascript and a bit of bootstrap for the styling of the site as well as used my own custom stylesheet to make some specific changes to the layout of the comments section, image, rating and buttons.

### Pros
* Easy to setup
* All the basic functionality of programming knowledge is easy to see based on the basic use of languages while not having to go through so many folders and files as you would need to if I was use a framework.

### Cons
* Probably too basic not complicated enough for you to base my work on.
* Not use of framework as you have probably wanted me to use so you could see how I make my routes / views and file structure.
